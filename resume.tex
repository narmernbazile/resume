%==== Projects ====%
\header{Projects}
{\textbf{Sudoku Solver}} {\sl Java} \hfill \\
An implementation of a sudoku solving backtracking algorithm in Java. Utilizes OOP design to model both the state of the puzzle and the moves previously made.\\
\vspace*{2mm}
{\textbf{External Virtual Memory Pager}} {\sl C++} \\
A robust external virtual memory pager implemented in C++. Receives and services memory requests from running processes to ensure that processesâ€™ data either exists in physical memory or on the disk, allowing processes to extend memory and then receive and write to virtual memory addresses, all of which are backed by swap space on the disk. Keeps the pages a process uses most frequently in physical memory and moves pages into and out of memory when necessary in an effort to minimize disk reads and writes.\\
